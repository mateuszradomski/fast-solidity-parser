     * the output token is the wrapped native token for the chain, then the recipient will receive native token if
     * an EOA or wrapped native token if a contract.
     * - inputToken: The token pulled from the caller's account to initiate the deposit. The equivalent of this
     * token on the repayment chain will be sent as a refund to the caller.
     * - outputToken The token that the caller will send to the recipient on the destination chain. Must be an

     * - inputAmount: This amount, less a system fee, will be sent to the caller on their repayment chain of choice as a refund
     * following an optimistic challenge window in the HubPool.
